# I Can See Your Voice

## Introduction

Welcome to the "I Can See Your Voice" project! This project is designed to classify voices as either real or fake, using AI-based deep fake detection techniques.

## Overview

"I Can See Your Voice" allows users to upload audio files for analysis. The system then predicts whether the voice in the file is real or generated by AI-based deep fake techniques. The project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for detecting deep fake voices.

## How to Use

1. **Upload File:** Select an audio file using the "Upload File" button.
2. **Prediction:** After uploading, the system will predict whether the voice is "Real," "Fake," or display an "Unknown Prediction."
3. **Result Display:** The prediction result is displayed below the upload button.

## Model

The voice classification model in this project is a RandomForestClassifier, trained using machine learning techniques. The model is capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated voices based on features extracted from audio files.

- **Technology:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - PyDub, Librosa, and Scikit-learn for audio processing.
  - RandomForestClassifier for voice classification.
  - Joblib for model serialization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/i-can-see-your-voice.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    - Frontend:

        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm install
        ```

    - Backend:

        ```bash
        cd backend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. Run the application:

    - Frontend:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

    - Backend:

        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

## Future Plans

- **Mobile Support:** We plan to enhance the user experience by adding mobile support. Users will be able to use the application on their mobile devices for on-the-go voice analysis.

- **Notification System:** We aim to implement a notification system that alerts users when the system detects a potential deep fake voice. This feature will provide real-time feedback and improve the overall user experience.
